My-SVG-Logo-Maker


Description:
------------

In this challenge we have been asked to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to input a colour, select a shape, and to enter text containing no more than 3 characters. We were required to create classes for the Triangle, Circle, and Square shape options. Each class was also tested for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape colour. This application uses Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer for collecting user input.


Installation:
-------------

To run this application the user will need to install the inquirer npm package version 8.2.4, the user will also need to install the jest npm package version 29.7.0.


Usage:
------

The application is invoked in the command line using 'node index.js'.
To run the tests the user will need to type 'npm run test' in the command line.
